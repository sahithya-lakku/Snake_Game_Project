# 🐍 Snake Game Project

Welcome to the **Snake Game** — a classic retro game reimagined in Java! This project was built for fun and learning, and it's ready for you to run, play, and enjoy.

## 🎮 Game Description

Control a snake as it slithers around the screen, eating food and growing longer. But be careful — if you hit the walls or run into yourself, it’s game over!

This project showcases basic game logic, graphics handling, and user input using core Java libraries.
